Finally, the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)-based blog established.  
 
Even though I have been learning English for a long time, I never thought to write in English seriously. So I wish this be a new and good start point. If you guys see that I have errors in my writing, don't hesitate to correct me. I'm always open to receiving your suggestions and encouragements. Thanks.  

I'm from China and currently I'm living in Dallas, TX, USA and I'm enjoying staying here. So many good people are living around and always ready to help me. I hope I also can open my heart to help others in the future just like those warm-hearted guys do to me today.  

So this is my very first post!
